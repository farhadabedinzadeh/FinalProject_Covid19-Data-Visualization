# FinalProject Covid19 Data Visualization

In the final project of this course, I used object-oriented programming techniques and developed a MATLAB application with professional graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that visualize COVID-19 pandemic data from around the world. I did enjoy doing this project as it's a good chance to apply newly learned skills to a real world problem.  The data obtained from the Coronavirus Resource Center at the Johns Hopkins University is available from the covid_data.mat file. (currently including data up till January 30th, 2021)
