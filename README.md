# FinalProject Covid19 Data Visualization

Instructor: [Mike Fitzpatrick](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/mikefitzpatrick)

This project is related to the second part of the specialization https://www.coursera.org/specializations/matlab-programming-engineers-scientists

In the final project of this course, I used object-oriented programming techniques and developed a MATLAB application with professional graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that visualize COVID-19 pandemic data from around the world. I did enjoy doing this project as it's a good chance to apply newly learned skills to a real world problem.  The data obtained from the [Coronavirus Resource Center at the Johns Hopkins University](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) is available from the covid_data.mat file. (currently including data up till January 30th, 2021)
